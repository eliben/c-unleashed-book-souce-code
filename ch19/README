Chapter 19 - Expression Parsing and Evaluation

This directory contains source code for processing
expressions written in an arbitrary language.

Unfortunately, the code doesn't work.

We tried very hard (through-the-night hard) to get this code
working before the book went to press, but it couldn't be done
in time.

We didn't give up, though, and we very much hope that, by
the time this book enters your possession, we will
have produced working code. Please check the
"C Unleashed" errata site, at:

http://users.powernet.co.uk/eton/unleashed/errata/index.html

for updated code.
