License Agreement:

This license agreement is intended to be even less restrictive than GPL agreements. 

This license agreement covers your use of the Dann Corbit Sorting Routines (DCSR), its source code, documentation, 
and executable files, hereinafter referred to as "the Product" or as "DCSR". 
 
In particular, you can use DCSR in proprietary software and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
that is built using DCSR. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the DCSR code, such as copyrighting it yourself or 
claiming authorship of the DCSR code, that will prevent DCSR from being distributed freely using an open source development model. 

Statement Of Copyright:
The Product is, and remains, Copyright © 1999 Dann Corbit, 
with exception of any specific copyrights noted in the individual source files.
You may use it and distribute it according to this following License Agreement. 
If you do not agree with these terms, please remove the Product from your system. 
By incorporating the Product in your work or distributing the Product to others 
you implicitly agree to these license terms. 

Conditions Of Use:
You do not need to provide the source code for the Product as part of your product. 
However, you must do one of these things to comply with the Product License Agreement: 

1.  Provide the source code for Product modules that you use, or 
2.  Make your product freely available according to a license similar to the GNU General Public License, or the Perl Artistic License, or 
3.  Add this phrase to the documentation for your product: "This product uses parts of the DCSR, Copyright © 1999 Dann Corbit". 

Rights Of Usage:
You may freely and at no cost use the Product in any project, commercial, academic, military, or private, 
so long as you respect the License Agreement. The License Agreement does not affect any software except the Product. 
In particular, any application that uses the Product does not itself fall under the License Agreement. 

You may modify any part of the Product, including sources and documentation, except this License Agreement, which you may not modify. 

You must clearly indicate any modifications at the start of each source file. 
The user of any modified Product code must know that the source file is not original. 

At your discretion, you may rewrite or reuse any part of the Product so that your derived code is not obviously part of the Product.
This derived code does not fall under the Product License Agreement directly, but you must include a credit at the start of each 
source file indicating the original authorship and source of the code, and a statement of copyright as follows:
"Parts copyright (c) 1999 Dann Corbit." 

Rights Of Distribution
You may freely distribute the Product, or any subset of the Product, by any means. 
The License, in the form of the file called "dscrlic.txt" must accompany any such distribution. 

You may charge a fee for distributing the Product, for providing a warranty on the Product, for making modifications to the Product, 
or for any other service provided in relation to the Product. You are not required to ask my permission for any of these activities. 

At no time will Dann Corbit associate himself with any distribution of the Product except that supplied from the book C Unleashed
or subsequent derivatives written by Dann Corbit or contributed by others and accepted by Dann Corbit.
