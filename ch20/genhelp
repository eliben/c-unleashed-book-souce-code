Generic helpfile. Consult crystal ball for full instructions.

Please note that the code generating routine is not clever enough to understand
that some characters need to be protected in printf statements. Therefore,
if you want your help display to contain special characters, they should be protected.

In other words, treat everything in this file as if it were in a printf statement.

Thus, \" for quotes, \\ for backslash (as in a DOS pathname)
