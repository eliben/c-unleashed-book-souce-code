
This is the source code supplement for chapter 3, Optimization and Optimism.
It contains:

Makefile--this is set up for a system which has gcc installed,
but there is no reason the included programs couldn't
be used on a different platform.

speed.c--this is a little program that exercises some basic language
constructs and measures how long they take on average.

bubble.c--this is a deliberately poorly written program that YOU
can optimize!  Use a profiler to find out which functions
are slow, then apply optimizations to speed it up.  Hints
are given in the chapter itself.

refs--for further reading on the subject of optimization.
