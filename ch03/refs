  This page looks at optimization from several
  different angles.  The section which lays
  waste to common misconceptions about optimization
  is a must-read.

  This page focuses on sample microoptimizations 
  that could help speed up your code, with 
  discussion of when such changes are useful and 
  appropriate.  It is essentially an expansion
  on the Microoptimization section in this chapter.
