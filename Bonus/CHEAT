Those with picky compilers, skip 20 lines.

Compile gcg8.c.

Run it, like this:

gcg8 > gcg7.c

Compile gcg7.c.

Run it, like this:

gcg7 > gcg6.c

Compile gcg6.c.

Run it, like this:

gcg6 > gcg5.c

Those with picky compilers, start here:

Compile gcg5.c.

Run it, like this:

gcg5 > gcg4.c

Keep doing this, compiling each output file in turn, until
you get gcg1.c. Compile this, run it, and save the output
as gcg.c.

Compile that, and run it like this:

gcg < anyCprogramYouLike > gen.c

Have a close look at gen.c

Compile it. Run it. Save the output. Compare the output to anyCprogramYouLike.c.

Notice anything odd?
