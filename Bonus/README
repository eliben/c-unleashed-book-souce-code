A little bonus for you, in the shape of a puzzle.

Take a look at gcg8.c. Without compiling it, try to find out what it does.

At some point, you may wish to compile it, of course. If your compiler rejects it as containing
too many characters per line (which your compiler is entitled to do), you may wish to compile
gcg5.c instead, which all ANSI C compilers must accept.

If you get stuck, read the CHEAT file.
