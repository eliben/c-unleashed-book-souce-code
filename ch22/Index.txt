/*Note - The u_cups.h and w_cups.h MUST be renamed

/* Note: Chad means...

If you're running Unix, copy u_cups.h to your Unix
system as cups.h, and use u_cups.c to build your library.

If you're running Windows, copy w_cups.h to your Windows
system as cups.h, and use w_cups.c to build your library.

If you're running both, do both.
