Here are directions for building the programs from their source
files and using them:

text2bin:

  This program generates binary images files from ordinary
  text files. It contains a 16x16 pixel character generator
  based on the original IBM PC text mode character set, so it
  produces glyphs for all values from 0 through 255, inclusive.

  The program is contained in a single source code file,
  text2bin.c, and includes only standard C headers. To build
  merely follow your compiler's standard procedure to generate
  an executable.

  To use the program, type text2bin file1 file2 from a command
  prompt. file1 is the name of an ordinary text file, file2 is
  the name of a new file to be created containing the binary
  output.

  Up to 108 characters from each line of text are converted, for
  up to 64 lines. The output binary is a simulation of a fax
  page scanned at standard resolution using approximately a 10
  point fixed pitch font, at approximately 6 lines per inch.

  The program does not require any specific sizes for C integral
  variable types, but it does output 8 pixels per unsigned char
  in the output file. If the implementation provides character
  types with more than 8 bits, only the lowest 8 bits are used
  and any higher bits are 0.

  Further information may be found in comments in the source.

lj300:

  This program generates binary files for an HP Laser Jet or
  compatible printer that accepts the 300 DPI raster graphics
  format. It assumes that the source file it processes contains
  216 unsigned chars per scan row, with the lowest 8 bits of
  each unsigned char containing 8 image pixels. This is the
  output format of the text2bin program and also corresponds
  to standard resolution fax scanned images.

  Because some laser printers do not handle more than 2400
  pixels per row gracefully, the program only outputs the
  left most 1600 pixels of each scan line. The 200 DPI
  horizontal and 100 DPI vertical image pixels are interpolated
  to expand them to 300 DIP. Up to 1024 scan lines are converted.

  The program is contained in a single source code file,
  lj300.c, and includes only standard C headers. To build
  merely follow your compiler's standard procedure to generate
  an executable.

  To use the program type lj300 file1 file2 from a command
  prompt. file1 is raw binary image input file as described
  above and as produced by text2bin. file2 is a considerably
  larger file containing the HP PCL sequence to reproduce the
  image contained in the binary file.

  If you have access to a compatible printer and are able to
  send files to it as raw binary, without interpretation or
  modification, it will reproduce the image on paper.

  On a Windows 95/98/NT computer, the file may be printed
  by typing the following at a command prompt:

  copy /b filename printer-port
